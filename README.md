# Number-Guessing-Game
A simple number guessing game /n
Project contains a .zip file with all of the Java/Class files. There is also an executable JAR file to run the game. /n
It is a simple guessing game you play against the computer, where you, the player, thinks of a number and the computer tries to guess it. The implementation behind it uses linked lists, but not the linked list class in JAVA. It uses a self implemented linked list class. It is a fun and simple game and I hope you enjoy! (There are further comments in the code that breaks down how it works in more detail.) /n
I recieved some help in formulating some of the tests and making the front end, (as at the time it was new to me) but all the logic was implemented by myself.
