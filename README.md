# Number-Guessing-Game
A simple number guessing game
Project contains a .zip file with all of the Java/Class files. There is also an executable JAR file to run the game.
It is a simple guessing game you play against the computer, where you, the player, thinks of a number and the computer tries to guess it. The implementation behind it uses linked lists, but not the linked list class in JAVA. It uses a self implemented linked list class. It is a fun and simple game and I hope you enjoy! (There are further comments in the code that breaks down how it works in more detail.)
